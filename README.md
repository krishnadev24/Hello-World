# Hello-World
First repository on Github


2020 was a disaster in so many ways for not just me but for majority people all over the world.

I am starting 2021 with a refined mindset. I am starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge. 

Started Day 1 by completing Week 1 of Crash course on Python course on coursera.

Hoping to achieve something meaningful in 2021.
